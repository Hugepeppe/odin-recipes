    <h1>Beef Goulash</h1>
    <p>A traditional goulash made from beef slices and a fair amount of onion, which does not need to be thickened with flour. It takes more time, but it pays off with full flavor and falling apart meat. With a dumpling and a few rings of raw onion, it is a pub classic</p>

    <p><h2>Ingridients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g of beef "Kli≈æka"</li>
        <li>500 g of onions</li>
        <li>3 spoons of lard</li>
        <li>2 spoons of sweet paprika</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 spoon of grinded or crushed cumin</li>
        <li>1 small tomato paste</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 spoon of marjoram</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>onion to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the onion. Heat the lard in a saucepan and fry the onion until brown. It takes about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the paprika to the onion, mix well and proceed quickly so that the paprika does not become bitter. Then add pieces of meat, brown them on all sides and mix well (the stew should stick to the bottom of the pot, but not burn). When the meat is fried, add salt (approx. 10 pinches) and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree, mix well and add a small amount of water - about 2 dl. Sprinkle cumin and pressed garlic into the base and let it simmer at the lowest possible temperature.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the stew and stir occasionally. We add water in small portions, because as already said, it should stick, but not burn.</li>
        <li>After about an hour and a half, taste the meat and if it is soft, add marjoram and cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>We don't have to (and we shouldn't) thicken the stew, the boiled onion base took care of that. The only thickener allowed is breadcrumbs if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve sprinkled with freshly chopped onions, preferably with a bun dumpling, or with potatoes or pasta.</li>
    </ol>
